abstract = {We present a model of soft active particles that leads to a rich array of collective behavior found also in dense biological swarms of bacteria and other unicellular organisms. Our model uses only local interactions, such as Vicsek-type nearest neighbor alignment, short-range repulsion, and a local boundary term. Changing the relative strength of these interactions leads to migrating swarms, rotating swarms and jammed swarms, as well as swarms that exhibit run-and-tumble motion, alternating between migration and either rotating or jammed states. Interestingly, although a migrating swarm moves slower than an individual particle, the diffusion constant can be up to three orders of magnitude larger, suggesting that collective motion can be highly advantageous, for example, when searching for food.},

abstract = {Bifurcation software is an essential tool in the study of dynamical systems. From the beginning (the first packages were written in the 1970's) it was also used in the modelling process, in particular to determine the values of critical parameters. More recently, it is used in a systematic way in the design of dynamical models and to determine which parameters are relevant. MatCont and ClMatCont are freely available matlab numerical continuation packages for the interactive study of dynamical systems and bifurcations. MatCont is the GUI-version, ClMatCont is the command-line version. The work started in 2000 and the first publications appeared in 2003. Since that time many new functionalities were added. Some of these are fairly simple but were never before implemented in continuation codes, e.g. Poincar maps. Others were only available as toolboxes that can be used by experts, e.g. continuation of homoclinic orbits. Several others were never implemented at all, such as periodic normal forms for codimension 1 bifurcations of limit cycles, normal forms for codimension 2 bifurcations of equilibria, detection of codimension 2 bifurcations of limit cycles, automatic computation of phase response curves and their derivatives, continuation of branch points of equilibria and limit cycles. New numerical algorithms for these computations have been published or will appear elsewhere; here we restrict to their software implementation. We further discuss software issues that are in practice important for many users, e.g. how to define a new system starting from an existing one, how to import and export data, system descriptions, and computed results.},

MCA has been used previously to approximate static, regular lattices, whereas application to dynamic, irregular networks is a new endeavour, and application to sociologically-motivated network models has not been attempted. Our goals are 1). to investigate issues relating to the application of moment closure approximations to dynamic and irregular networks, and 2). to understand the impact of concurrent casual partnerships on STD transmission through a population of predominantly steady monogamous partnerships. We are able to derive a moment closure approximation for a dynamic irregular network representing sexual partnership dynamics, however, we are forced to use a triple approximation due to the large error of the standard pair approximation. This example underscores the importance of doing error analysis for moment closure approximations. We also find that a small number of casual partnerships drastically increases the prevalence and rate of spread of the epidemic. Finally, although the approximation is derived for a specific network model, we can recover approximations to a broad range of network models simply by varying model parameters which control the structure of the dynamic network. Thus our moment closure approximation is very flexible in the kinds of network models it can approximate.},

abstract = {We have shown previously that the AKT2 pathway is essential for cell survival and important in malignant transformation. In this study, we demonstrate elevated kinase levels of AKT2 and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) in 32 of 80 primary breast carcinomas. The majority of the cases with the activation are estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) positive, which prompted us to examine whether AKT2 regulates ERalpha activity. We found that constitutively activated AKT2 or AKT2 activated by epidermal growth factor or insulin-like growth factor-1 promotes the transcriptional activity of ERalpha. This effect occurred in the absence or presence of estrogen. Activated AKT2 phosphorylates ERalpha in vitro and in vivo, but it does not phosphorylate a mutant ERalpha in which ser-167 was replaced by Ala. The PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, abolishes both the phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of ERalpha induced by AKT2. However, AKT2-induced ERalpha activity was not inhibited by tamoxifen but was completely abolished by ICI 164,384, implicating that AKT2-activated ERalpha contributes to tamoxifen resistance. Moreover, we found that ERalpha binds to the p85alpha regulatory subunit of PI3K in the absence or presence of estradiol in epithelial cells and subsequently activates PI3K/AKT2, suggesting ERalpha regulation of PI3K/AKT2 through a nontranscriptional and ligand-independent mechanism. These data indicate that regulation between the ERalpha and PI3K/AKT2 pathway (ERalpha-PI3K/AKT2-ERalpha) may play an important role in pathogenesis of human breast cancer and could contribute to ligand-independent breast cancer cell growth.},

abstract = {We present a quantitative continuum theory of ``flocking'': the collective coherent motion of large numbers of self-propelled organisms. Our model predicts the existence of an ``ordered phase'' of flocks, in which all members of the flock move together with the same mean velocity. This coherent motion of the flock is an example of spontaneously broken symmetry. The ``Goldstone modes'' associated with this ``spontaneously broken rotational symmetry'' are fluctuations in the direction of motion of a large part of the flock away from the mean direction. These ``Goldstone modes'' mix with modes associated with conservation of bird number to produce propagating sound modes. These sound modes lead to enormous fluctuations of the density of the flock. Our model is similar in many ways to the Navier-Stokes equations for a simple compressible fluid; in other ways, it resembles a relaxational time dependent Ginsburg-Landau theory for an {\$}n = d{\$} component isotropic ferromagnet. In spatial dimensions {\$}d {\textgreater} 4{\$}, the long distance behavior is correctly described by a linearized theory. For {\$}d {\textless} 4{\$}, non-linear fluctuation effects radically alter the long distance behavior, making it different from that of any known equilibrium model. In particular, we find that in {\$}d = 2{\$}, where we can calculate the scaling exponents $\backslash$underline{\{}exactly{\}}, flocks exhibit a true, long-range ordered, spontaneously broken symmetry state, in contrast to equilibrium systems, which cannot spontaneously break a continuous symmetry in {\$}d = 2{\$} (the ``Mermin-Wagner'' theorem).

The observations we report on include systems consisting of units ranging from macromolecules through metallic rods and robots to groups of animals and people. Some emphasis is put on models that are simple and realistic enough to reproduce the numerous related observations and are useful for developing concepts for a better understanding of the complexity of systems consisting of many simultaneously moving entities. As such, these models allow the establishing of a few fundamental principles of flocking. In particular, it is demonstrated, that in spite of considerable differences, a number of deep analogies exist between equilibrium statistical physics systems and those made of self-propelled (in most cases living) units. In both cases only a few well defined macroscopic/collective states occur and the transitions between these states follow a similar scenario, involving discontinuity and algebraic divergences. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {During the evolution of many systems found in nature, both the system composition and the interactions between components will vary. Equating the dimension with the number of different components, a system which adds or deletes components belongs to a class of dynamical systems with a finite dimensional phase space of variable dimension. We present two models of biochemical systems with a variable phase space, a model of autocatalytic reaction networks in the prebiotic soup and a model of the idiotypic network of the immune system. Each model contains characteristic meta-dynamical rules for constructing equations of motion from component properties. The simulation of each model occurs on two levels. On one level, the equations of motion are integrated to determine the state of each component. On a second level, algorithms which approximate physical processes in the real system are employed to change the equations of motion. Models with meta-dynamical rules possess several advantages for the study of evolving systems. First, there are no explicit fitness functions to determine how the components of the model rank in terms of survivability. The success of any component is a function of its relationship to the rest of the system. A second advantage is that since the phase space representation of the system is always finite but continually changing, we can explore a potentially infinite phase space which would otherwise be inaccessible with finite computer resources. Third, the enlarged capacity of systems with meta-dynamics for variation allows us to conduct true evolution experiments. The modeling methods presented here can be applied to many real biological systems. In the two studies we present, we are investigating two apparent properties of adaptive networks. With the simulation of the prebiotic soup, we are most interested in how a chemical reaction network might emerge from an initial state of relative disorder. With the study of the immune system, we study the self-regulation of the network including its ability to distinguish between species which are part of the network and those which are not.},

abstract = {Complex systems can often be modelled as networks, in which their basic units are represented by abstract nodes and the interactions among them by abstract links. This network of interactions is the key to understanding emergent collective phenomena in such systems. In most cases, it is an adaptive network, which is defined by a feedback loop between the local dynamics of the individual units and the dynamical changes of the network structure itself. This feedback loop gives rise to many novel phenomena. Adaptive networks are a promising concept for the investigation of collective phenomena in different systems. However, they also present a challenge to existing modelling approaches and analytical descriptions due to the tight coupling between local and topological degrees of freedom. In this work, which is essentially my PhD thesis, I present a simple rule-based framework for the investigation of adaptive networks, using which a wide range of collective phenomena can be modelled and analysed from a common perspective. In this framework, a microscopic model is defined by the local interaction rules of small network motifs, which can be implemented in stochastic simulations straightforwardly. Moreover, an approximate emergent-level description in terms of macroscopic variables can be derived from the microscopic rules, which we use to analyse the system's collective and long-term behaviour by applying tools from dynamical systems theory. We discuss three adaptive-network models for different collective phenomena within our common framework. First, we propose a novel approach to collective motion in insect swarms, in which we consider the insects' adaptive interaction network instead of explicitly tracking their positions and velocities. We capture the experimentally observed onset of collective motion qualitatively in terms of a bifurcation in this non-spatial model. We find that three-body interactions are an essential ingredient for collective motion to emerge. Moreover, we show what minimal microscopic interaction rules determine whether the transition to collective motion is continuous or discontinuous. Second, we consider a model of opinion formation in groups of individuals, where we focus on the effect of directed links in adaptive networks. Extending the adaptive voter model to directed networks, we find a novel fragmentation mechanism, by which the network breaks into distinct components of opposing agents. This fragmentation is mediated by the formation of self-stabilizing structures in the network, which do not occur in the undirected case. We find that they are related to degree correlations stemming from the interplay of link directionality and adaptive topological change. Third, we discuss a model for the evolution of cooperation among self-interested agents, in which the adaptive nature of their interaction network gives rise to a novel dynamical mechanism promoting cooperation. We show that even full cooperation can be achieved asymptotically if the networks' adaptive response to the agents' dynamics is sufficiently fast. {\textcopyright} 2012 EDP Sciences and Springer.},

Individual agents begin to interact at random, with the interactions modeled as games. The game payoffs determine which interactions are reinforced, and the network structure emerges as a consequence of the dynamics of the agents' learning behavior. We study this in a variety of game-theoretic conditions and show that the behavior is complex and sometimes dissimilar to behavior in the absence of structural dynamics. We argue that modeling network structure as dynamic increases realism without rendering the problem of analysis intractable.},

abstract = {Social interaction between individuals constantly affects the development of their personal opinions. Previous models such as the Deffuant model and the Hegselmann-Krause (HK) model have assumed that individuals only update their opinions after interacting with neighbors whose opinions are similar to their own. However, people are capable of communicating widely with all of their neighbors to gather their ideas and opinions, even if they encounter a number of opposing attitudes. We propose a model in which agents listen to the opinions of all their neighbors. Continuous opinion dynamics are investigated in activity-driven networks with a tolerance threshold. We study how the initial opinion distribution, tolerance threshold, opinion-updating speed, and activity rate affect the evolution of opinion. We find that when the initial fraction of positive opinion is small, all opinions become negative by the end of the simulation. As the initial fraction of positive opinions rises above a certain value —about 0.45— the final fraction of positive opinions sharply increases and eventually equals 1. Increased tolerance threshold $\delta$ is found to lead to a more varied final opinion distribution. We also find that if the negative opinion has an initial advantage, the final fraction of negative opinion increases and reaches its peak as the updating speed $\lambda$ approaches 0.5. Finally we show that the lower the activity rate of individuals, the greater the fluctuation range of their opinions.},

abstract = {A simple model with a novel type of dynamics is introduced in order to investigate the emergence of self-ordered motion in systems of particles with biologically motivated interaction. In our model particles are driven with a constant absolute velocity and at each time step assume the average direction of motion of the particles in their neighborhood with some random perturbation (g) added. We present numerical evidence that this model results in a kinetic phase transition from no transport (zero average velocity, {\~{}}v, ( = 0) to finite net transport through spontaneous symmetry breaking of the rotational {\~{}} symmetry. The transition is continuous, since {\~{}}v, is found to scale as (71, —g)t with p = 0.45},

These models provide an approximate description of a set of systems where nodes represent agents moving in physical or abstract space, the state of each node represents the agent's heading direction, and links indicate mutual awareness. We show analytically that the adaptive network description captures a phase transition to collective motion in some swarming systems, such as the Vicsek model, and that the properties of this transition are determined by the number of states (discrete heading directions) that can be accessed by each agent.},

abstract = {Many real-world networks are characterized by adaptive changes in their topology depending on the state of their nodes. Here we study epidemic dynamics on an adaptive network, where the susceptibles are able to avoid contact with the infected by rewiring their network connections. This gives rise to assortative degree correlation, oscillations, hysteresis, and first order transitions. We propose a low-dimensional model to describe the system and present a full local bifurcation analysis. Our results indicate that the interplay between dynamics and topology can have important consequences for the spreading of infectious diseases and related applications.},

abstract = {We propose a simple adaptive-network model describing recent swarming experiments. Exploiting an analogy with human decision making, we capture the dynamics of the model using a low-dimensional system of equations permitting analytical investigation. We find that the model reproduces several characteristic features of swarms, including spontaneous symmetry breaking, noise-and density-driven order–disorder transitions that can be of first or second order, and intermittency. Reproducing these experimental observations using a non-spatial model suggests that spatial geometry may have less of an impact on collective motion than previously thought.},

abstract = {This is a book on nonlinear dynamical systems and their bifurcations under parameter variation. It provides a reader with a solid basis in dynamical systems theory, as well as explicit procedures for application of general mathematical results to particular problems. Special attention is given to efficient numerical implementations of the developed techniques. Several examples from recent research papers are used as illustrations. The book is designed for advanced undergraduate or graduate students in applied mathematics, as well as for Ph.D. students and researchers in physics, biology, engineering, and economics who use dynamical systems as model tools in their studies. A moderate mathematical background is assumed, and, whenever possible, only elementary mathematical tools are used. This new edition preserves the structure of the 1st edition while updating the context to incorporate recent theoretical developments, in particular new and improved numerical methods for bifurcation analysis. Review of 1st Edition: "I know of no other book that so clearly explains the basic phenomena of bifurcation theory." Math Reviews "The book is a fine addition to the dynamical systems literature. It is good to see, in our modern rush to quick publication, that we, as a mathematical community, still have time to bring together, and in such a readable and considered form, the important results on our subject."

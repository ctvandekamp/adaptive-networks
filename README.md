# adaptive-networks
This repository contains files and scripts used to generate results for my bachelor thesis 'On discrete and continuous state adaptive network models'. The first few lines in each script indicate what it does and add some extra comments.

The thesis can also be found at in the TU Delft repository at http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:9b4b4396-4288-4c89-b8a4-1e52c75d83bc
